This is an R markdown document. It's like a markdown document, but has 
executable snippets of code that do the work (in various languages, including
bash, Python, R). It can be viewed using RStudio---we recommend doing this.

    rstudio 0-prerequisites.Rmd

It can also be executed (in whole) with R using the following bash snippet:*
 
    Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('0-prerequisites.Rmd')"

This will compile the document into HTML while executing all the code 
snippets in the document.

> If you are using the provided artifact VM, no code in this notebook needs to be executed as all prerequisites have already been installed for you.

# Prerequisites

This document describes all the components that need to be installed to run the
artifact. We provide code snippets to install all libraries in Ubuntu.

We installed all the prerequisite dependencies on the artifact image, so the
user of the artifact does not *need* to run these to use the artifact.

## General dependencies

Git:

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

Curl:

```bash
sudo apt install curl
```

Misc. bindings, tools, and programming libraries (SSL, libgit2, cmake, libicu, zlib1g, cloc, pkg-config)

```bash
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libgit2-dev cmake pkg-config libicu-dev zlib1g-dev cloc
```

## Rust and Cargo

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo install --git https://github.com/PRL-PRG/cargo-djanco
```

## Ruby and Ruby packages

```bash
sudo apt install ruby-dev
gem install github-linguist
```

## R and R packages

```bash
sudo apt install r-base
R -e 'install.packages(c("MASS", "readr", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "knitr", "data.table", "assertthat", "fst", "stringr", "ggrepel", "scales", "xtable", "gplots", "plyr", "gridExtra", "grid", "tidyr"))'

```

## R studio

```bash
sudo apt install gdebi
curl https://download1.rstudio.org/desktop/bionic/amd64/rstudio-1.4.1106-amd64.deb > rstudio-1.4.1106-amd64.deb
sudo gdebi rstudio-1.4.1106-amd64.deb
R -e 'install.packages(c("reticulate"))'
```

## Python and Python packages

```bash
sudo apt install python3 python-is-python3 python3-pip
pip3 install jupyter numpy seaborn pandas
```

```{r}
library(reticulate)
# Install any uninstalled Python packages for reticulate
py_install("pandas")
py_install("numpy")
py_install("matplotlib")
py_install("seaborn")
```
