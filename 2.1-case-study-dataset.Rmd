NOTE

This is an R markdown document. It's like a markdown document, but has 
executable snippets of code that do the work (in various languages, including
bash, Python, R). It can be viewed using Rstudio---we recommend doing this.

    rstudio 2.1-case-study-dataset.Rmd

It can also be executed (in whole) with R using the following bash snippet:*
 
    Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('2.1-case-study-dataset.Rmd')"

This will compile the document into HTML while executing all the code 
snippets in the document.

This is the root document of the artifact. Start reading here.

# Part 2.1. Case study: dataset

Prepares the data and plots the graphs for Section 4 *A Case Study: Of Bugs and
Languages* in the paper. This requires downloading the data, performing the
queries, and processing the results.

The dataset used in the analysis in the paper is constructed by downloading the
repositories listed in `paper-dataset-repositories.csv` containing 229,933
GitHub URLs. We provide a pre-downloaded dataset at
`https://147.32.233.132/codedj-artifact-ecoop21/dataset.tgz`:

```
cd datasets
wget https://147.32.233.132/codedj-artifact-ecoop21/dataset.tgz
tar -xvf dataset.tgz
```

> We do not recommend downloading it yourself since it will take a significant
amount of time (days) and disk space (hundreds of gigabytes). Nevertheless, you
can. You require a `ghtokens.csv` file containing at least one valid GitHub
personal access token.

```
token
fa56454....
```

Create a directory for the dataset:
```bash
mkdir -p dataset/
mkdir -p dataset/repo_clones
```

Then, add the repositories to the dataset:

```bash
parasite/target/release/parasite --datastore paper-dataset add paper-dataset-repositories.csv
```

Then, turn on interactive mode and start the download by executing 
`loadall` followed by `updateall`.

```bash
parasite/target/release/parasite --datastore paper-dataset -ght ghtokens.csv -n 8 --interactive
```

Wait until completed.
