NOTE

This is an R markdown document. It's like a markdown document, but has 
executable snippets of code that do the work (in various languages, including
bash, Python, R). It can be viewed using Rstudio---we recommend doing this.

    rstudio 3-caching-performance.Rmd

It can also be executed (in whole) with R using the following bash snippet:*
 
    Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('3-caching-performance.Rmd')"

This will compile the document into HTML while executing all the code 
snippets in the document.

This is the root document of the artifact. Start reading here.

# Part 3. Caching performance

We have benchamrked and pre-tuned Djanco to cache only when it is clearly
adventageous. The paper shows the performance of caching on a dataset
containing 130K projects and 44M commits. For the artifact we prepared a
smaller dataset of 1K projects.
