This is an R markdown document. It's like a markdown document, but has 
executable snippets of code that do the work (in various languages, including
bash, Python, R). It can be viewed using RStudio---we recommend doing this.

    rstudio 2-case-study.Rmd

It can also be executed (in whole) with R using the following bash snippet:*
 
    Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('2-case-study.Rmd')"

This will compile the document into HTML while executing all the code 
snippets in the document.

# Part 2. Case study: of bugs and languages

The paper's motivation is the claim that the selection of inputs matters in
empirical studies of software and that Code DJ can assist researchers in that
process. We illustrate these points with a case study. We start from prior
work, and show that input selection impacts scientific claims, and that Code DJ
allows rapid exploration of the input space.

This section of the artifact aims to replicate the case study in three parts:

- background,
- download the dataset,
- perform project selection for the queries in the paper,
- perform experiments from the paper.

The stages are described below and details for re-running them are provided in
separate RMD files.

#### Background

The work’s motivation is the claim that the selection of inputs matters in
empirical studies of software and that Code DJ can assist researchers in that
process. We illustrate these points with a case study. We start from prior
work, and show that input selection impacts scientific claims, and that Code DJ
allows rapid exploration of the input space.

The starting point is an FSE 2014 paper:

Baishakhi Ray, Daryl Posnett, Vladimir Filkov, and Premkumar Devanbu. *A large
scale study of programming languages and code quality in GitHub*. In
International Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE), 2014.
![doi:10.1145/2635868.2635922](doi:10.1145/2635868.2635922).

One contribution of the work is to establish that some programming languages
have a greater association with defects than others (RQ1).  The methodology
followed there can be summarized as follows. For 17 popular languages, select
50 projects hosted on GitHub that have at least 28 commits. For each commit
touching a file that contains code in one of the target languages, label the
commit as bug-fixing if its message contains a bug-related keyword. Fit a
Negative Binomial Regression (NBR) against the labeled data and obtain, for
each language, a coefficient and a p-value.  The coefficient indicates the
strength of the association (positive means more bugs), and the p-value tells
us about statistical significance (less than .05 means the coefficient is
significant).  The FSE 2014 paper concluded that TypeScript, Clojure, Haskell,
Ruby and Scala were associated with fewer bugs, while C, C++, Objective-C,
JavaScript, PHP and Python were associated with more bugs. The remaining
languages did not have statistically significant coefficients. 

Our first experiment explores the distribution of possible analysis outcomes. 

## Download the dataset

This stage downloads the dataset used to perform the study. 

The dataset used in the analysis in the paper is constructed by downloading the
repositories listed in `paper-dataset-repositories.csv` containing 230K GitHub
URLs. The downloaded dataset takes up 36GB on disk and contains ~230K projects
and 47M unique commits.

The dataset itself is not strictly necessary to run the remainder of the case
study, so getting it is optional.

The following document provides instructions on how to either download the
pre-constructed dataset from our servers or to construct one from scratch.

### A note on development history of Parasite and Djanco

The system used for the study in the paper has undergone development since the
paper was submitted.  We converted the original dataset to the new format
rather than re-downloading it.  The current dataset (described in the paper)
collects slightly different data from different sources: 

The **original** dataset was seeded with data from GHTorrent: commits, star
counts and issue information. We found this data to be very rough (big
differences from values seen on GitHub, not present for all projects), so our
current version of the downloader ditches GHTorrent in favor of downloading
project metadata using the GitHub API and provides different metadata for
projects.

The **current** version has new attributes that the old version did not have.
On the other hand, the current version does not retrieve issues counts because
they are very uneconomical to obtain via the GitHub API.

This has a few implications for the artifact: The converted dataset has many
empty project attributes that the original dataset did not collect: `IsFork`,
`IsArchived`, `IsDisabled`, `Watchers`, `Open_issues`, `Forks`, `Subscribers`,
`HasIssues`, `HasDownloads`, `HasWiki`, `HasPages`, `DefaultBranch`, `License`,
`Homepage`, and `Description`.  If the reader writes their own queries using
these attributes and  the provided dataset, these will be empty.  If the
dataset were to be updated, or redownloaded from scratch, it will contain
these, but not `Issues`, `BuggyIssues` and `AllIssues`, which we have retained
during the conversion. 

The current dataset stores entities more efficiently in terms of disk space: it
takes up 36GB on disk, rather than 51GB as mentioned in the original version of
the paper. This will be fixed in the camera ready version.

## Perform project selection for the queries in the paper

Choosing any subset of a larger population introduces bias, but this may be
intentional, reflecting domain knowledge about the relative importance of
observations. For instance, small projects with few commits may be less
interesting as they correlate with student projects. These projects have fewer
descriptive commit messages and their defects reflect beginner mistakes. It
stands to reason to exclude such projects from consideration. Justifying the
choice of any particular selection criterion is beyond the scope of our work.
What Code DJ can do is let researchers explore the impact of various subsets
their criteria produce. The experiment in the paper looks at several different
criteria for selecting projects based on popularity:

* **Stars:** Pick projects with most stars. Rationale: starred projects are 
  popular and thus likely to be well written and maintained. 
* **Touched Files:** compute #files changed by commits, pick projects that
  changed the most files. Rationale: indicative of projects where commits 
  represent larger units of work.
* **Experienced Author:** experienced developers are those on GitHub for at 
  least two years; pick a sample of projects with at least one experienced 
  contributor. Rationale: less likely to be throw-away projects.
* **50% Experienced:** projects with two or more developers, half of which 
  experienced. Rationale: focus on larger teams.
* **Message Size:** Compute size in bytes of commit messages; pick projects 
  with the largest size. Rationale: empty or trivial commit messages 
  indicate uninteresting projects.
* **Number of Commits:** Compute the number of commits; pick projects with the 
  most commits. Rationale: larger projects are more mature.
* **Issues:** Pick projects with the most issues. Rationale: issues indicate 
  a more structured development process.

The following document provides instructions on how execute the queries on the
dataset. This step also post-processes the data and creates. 

[2.2-case-study-project-selection.Rmd](2.2-case-study-project-selection.Rmd)

The queries take a long time to execute on our relatively beefy rig (hours) and
are very hard to execute on laptops and desktops within reasonable time. If the
reader does not wish to re-execute them (or to download the full dataset) they
can be skipped. We provide the results of the queries in `query-results`.

The queries each create a file containing project IDs of projects in the
dataset and a CSV file containing summary information about each project.

### Perform experiments from the paper

This section processes the results from the previous sections and generates
figures. Additional data is attached to the project list from the dataset.
Then, data is processed and analyzed using R. The final part of the analysis
and graph generation is done in Python. 

All the code snippets are embedded in this RMD file and are one-click
executable from RStudio.

The following experiments are discussed in detail:

- Random subsets (Fig. 4)
- TypeScript over time (Fig. 5)
- Domain knowledge (Fig. 6)
- Domain knowledge (Fig. 7)

The following document provides the details and runnable scripts re-creating
the pipeline:
